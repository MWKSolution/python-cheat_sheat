# typing


---

## Brief

Not usefull for short personal scripts  
type hints should be used whenever unit tests are worth writing  
type hinst are stored in __annotations __

## Simple types

```python
int     # integer
float   # floating point number
bool    # boolean value (subclass of int)
str     # text, sequence of unicode codepoints
bytes   # 8-bit string, sequence of byte values
object  # an arbitrary object (object is the common base class)
```

## Any type

```python
Any  # dynamically typed value with an arbitrary type
```

## Generic types

```python
from typing import List, Tuple, ...
List[str]         # list of str objects
Tuple[int, int]   # tuple of two int objects (Tuple[()] is the empty tuple)
Tuple[int, ...]   # tuple of an arbitrary number of int objects
Dict[str, int]    # dictionary from str keys to int values
Iterable[int]     # iterable object containing ints
Sequence[bool]    # sequence of booleans (read-only)
Mapping[str, int] # mapping from str keys to int values (read-only)
Type[C]           # type object of C (C is a class/type variable/union of types)
Sequence[int]     # any sequence: list, tuple, ... (anything supporting len() and __getitem __()
```

## Functions

```python
from typing import Union, Optional, ...
None             # if function doesn't return a value use -> None !!!! __init__()
Union[int, str]  # variable/argument is int or str
Optional[int]    # variable/argument is int or None
Callable[[<arguments>], <output>]  # for functons as arguments
NoReturn         # for functions that never return
```

## Aliases and stuff...
```python
from typing import Tuple, TypeVar, NewType
MyNewType1 = Tuple[str, ...]  # new type as tuple of some strings
MyNewType2 = TypeVar('MyNewType2', str, int)
MyNewType3 = NewType('MyNewType3', Tuple[str, ...])
```

## Protocols
[Predefined protocol reference](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/protocols.html#predefined-protocol-reference)  

## Class as Type

Just use class Name.  
When not fully defined use string literal or :
```python
from __future__ import annotations
```

## Stub files

 A stub file is a text file that contains the signatures of methods and functions, but not their implementations. Their main function is to add type hints to code that you for some reason canâ€™t change.  


## MyPy
Use "TYPE_CHECKING" if you want to have code that mypy can see but will not be executed at runtime
```python
if TYPE_CHECKING:
    print('Seen by MyPy but not executed')
else:
    print('Executed but not seen by MyPy')
```

## Pydantic

Checking type hints at runtime.
